# Decision Log

Forward-facing, append-only record of architectural and behavioral decisions for this project. Read this file at the start of each session — it is more reliable than memory and supersedes any conflicting claims in AGENTS.md or README.

When a decision is reversed or superseded, append a new entry rather than rewriting the old one.

## 2026-08-14 — Use a clean-sheet implementation

- **Decision:** Replacement firmware will be implemented from public hardware documentation and manufacturer MCU support, without extracting or reproducing Makerbase firmware or its bootloader.
- **Why:** The goal is a maintainable open implementation, not recovery or emulation of undocumented proprietary code.
- **Supersedes:** (initial)
- **Affects:** Project scope, firmware architecture, protocol compatibility work

## 2026-08-14 — Treat the repository as a gated feasibility project

- **Decision:** Work proceeds through explicit debug-access, passive-bring-up, power-stage, current-loop, and servo-control gates; motor output is not an initial milestone.
- **Why:** MCU protection and safe bridge behavior must be proven before substantial control-software investment.
- **Supersedes:** (initial)
- **Affects:** `PLAN.md`, `docs/BRINGUP.md`, firmware milestone ordering

## 2026-08-14 — Keep external binary material local by default

- **Decision:** Manufacturer archives, programming executables, schematics, manuals, and generated analysis files live under ignored `vendor/local/`, `reference/local/`, and `scratch/` directories.
- **Why:** The future public repository should not redistribute external binaries or documents until provenance and redistribution rights are recorded.
- **Supersedes:** (initial)
- **Affects:** `.gitignore`, `vendor/`, `reference/`, repository layout

## 2026-08-14 — Use CMSIS-DAP as the baseline programming path

- **Decision:** The initial programming/debug path is a Raspberry Pi Pico running CMSIS-DAP v1/HID, paired with the Nations utility for recovery and pyOCD plus the N32 CMSIS pack for development.
- **Why:** It supports the vendor's full programming workflow, is reproducible, and avoids the J-Link EDU Mini commercial-use restriction.
- **Supersedes:** (initial)
- **Affects:** Phase 1 bring-up, host tooling, programmer documentation

## 2026-08-14 — Sample the board's external current amplifiers directly

- **Decision:** The initial design will sample `currentB` on PA1 and `currentA` on PA2 directly rather than enabling the MCU's internal op-amps.
- **Why:** The PCB already provides GS8632 current amplifiers, while the internal op-amp pin routing conflicts with the two existing current-sense nets.
- **Supersedes:** (initial)
- **Affects:** ADC configuration, current-loop design, hardware assumptions
