# Project Tools

Project-owned host tools, probe firmware configuration, build helpers, and test utilities live here.

Manufacturer executables and archives belong under ignored `vendor/local/`, not in this directory.

`build.ps1` configures and builds the Arm firmware and/or the native unit tests. It does not flash hardware or execute anything from `vendor/local/`.

```powershell
pwsh -File tools/build.ps1 -Target all
```

`reference_cache.py` verifies cataloged local PDFs, extracts searchable
page-level text, and creates provenance-tracked page renders on demand. Its
generated cache is ignored. See [the reference-cache workflow](../docs/REFERENCE_CACHE.md).

```powershell
python tools/reference_cache.py status
python tools/reference_cache.py build n32l40x-um-v2.6
python tools/reference_cache.py search "SRAM2 parity"
```
